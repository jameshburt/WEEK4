<!--The Casino Story-->
<!--This story is about a man named James Harrison. He finally turns 28 years old on June 5, 2021. 
    James finds out that he is finally able to open his own casino on Mars because there is an 
    available slot for a business to be built. His twin brother William finally gives into partaking 
    in coming up with and managing all drinks, baking, and cooking recipes as well as the areas of the casino.
    I own the Ci-Fi Casino or (CC) what people refer to when they come by the casino. There are many 
    new innovative type games using mind control but most of what the Ci-Fi Casino is used for is entertainment
    There is no currency on Mars. It is like the first colonization of the United States of America 
    without all the wars. We make things from the planet as well as it being terraformed from our own planet 
    from humans. There are many awesome ways the casino was bulit. We used electro-magnetic technology and 
    A.I., controlling robots to form the new livable planet of Mars. Having new innovation from our new 
    integrated minds with computer science technology. Everyone is cured from diseases and mental genetic 
    "messups" from the gene pool being too far spread apart not keeping every human linked. Now all humans 
    live on a new platform within all of the same generated computer system but pretty much is a free-for-all 
    awesome, I would say heavenly experience. Back to the casino, it is very much based off all, old Mars human 
    relation of ideas, every single human is equal to each other so but very upgraded with intelligence from
    old Advanced Computer Science used for all this new creation. James finally lifts off with his brother, 
    on a SpaceX Starship, and heads on to Mars to start their new amazing business and opportunity to 
    live forever, as humans do now and colonize more casinos on other Earth-Like Planets in the future. What
    they always dreamed of doing.-->
